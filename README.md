# Gaussian Process and Disagreement Visualization

## Introduction

This repo for visualizing Disagreement or Uncertainty in Gaussian Processes (GPs) to illutrasing the concepts for exploration in Reinforment Learning, especially these papers: "MaxInfoRL: Boosting exploration in reinforcement learning through information gain maximization", "Self-Supervised Exploration via Disagreement", "Curiosity-driven Exploration by Self-supervised Prediction" and "Optimistic Active Exploration of Dynamical Systems".

This interactive web application provides powerful tools for visualizing Gaussian Processes (GPs), their uncertainty, and model disagreement. Built with React, TypeScript, and D3.js, it offers an intuitive interface for exploring key concepts in probabilistic machine learning.

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular, component-based architecture:

```
GaussianProcess/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpVisualization.tsx       # Main visualization component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpControls.tsx            # Parameter control interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpAnimation.tsx           # Animation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpExplanation.tsx         # Educational explanations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts                  # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ visualization/            # Modular D3.js visualization components
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AxesComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ConfidenceBandsComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DataPointsComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GuideLineComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SampleLinesComponent.tsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClickInteractionComponent.tsx
```

State management is handled with both React's useState and a Zustand store for global state, with careful synchronization between them.

## Mathematical Background

Gaussian Processes are a powerful framework for Bayesian non-parametric machine learning. Key concepts implemented in this visualization:

- **Kernel Functions**: Squared Exponential kernel with configurable lengthscale and variance
- **Posterior Distribution**: Exact inference for regression with Gaussian noise
- **Model Uncertainty**: Visualization of predictive variance
- **Disagreement Metrics**: Implementation of variance-based and information-theoretic disagreement measures

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive data visualization
- **Math Libraries**: ML-Matrix for linear algebra operations
- **State Management**: React hooks + Zustand
