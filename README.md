## Introduction

This interactive web application provides powerful tools for visualizing Gaussian Processes (GPs), their uncertainty, and model disagreement. Built with React, TypeScript, and D3.js, it offers an intuitive interface for exploring key concepts in probabilistic machine learning.

## Features

### üßÆ Interactive Gaussian Process Model

*Screenshot of the main GP visualization with data points and confidence bands*

- **Real-time GP inference**: Watch how the model updates as you add data points
- **Confidence bands**: Visualize model uncertainty with 1œÉ and 2œÉ confidence intervals
- **Draggable data points**: Click to add observations or drag existing points to see how the model adapts
- **Function selection**: Choose from predefined functions (sine, quadratic, linear) or add points manually

### üìä Disagreement Visualization

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular, component-based architecture:

```
GaussianProcess/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpVisualization.tsx       # Main visualization component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpControls.tsx            # Parameter control interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpAnimation.tsx           # Animation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GpExplanation.tsx         # Educational explanations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts                  # TypeScript type definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ visualization/            # Modular D3.js visualization components
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AxesComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ConfidenceBandsComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DataPointsComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ GuideLineComponent.tsx
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SampleLinesComponent.tsx
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ClickInteractionComponent.tsx
```

State management is handled with both React's useState and a Zustand store for global state, with careful synchronization between them.

## Mathematical Background

Gaussian Processes are a powerful framework for Bayesian non-parametric machine learning. Key concepts implemented in this visualization:

- **Kernel Functions**: Squared Exponential kernel with configurable lengthscale and variance
- **Posterior Distribution**: Exact inference for regression with Gaussian noise
- **Model Uncertainty**: Visualization of predictive variance
- **Disagreement Metrics**: Implementation of variance-based and information-theoretic disagreement measures

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive data visualization
- **Math Libraries**: ML-Matrix for linear algebra operations
- **State Management**: React hooks + Zustand

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash

   ```
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

## Educational Use Cases

This tool is designed for both students and educators to gain intuition about:

- How Gaussian Processes represent uncertainty
- The impact of kernel hyperparameters on predictions
- How model disagreement can help identify areas needing more data
- The relationship between data density and prediction confidence
